    "Implement efficient navigation and routing across different views such as Home, Bundles, Series, and NotFound.",
    "Build a reusable UI component library to standardize the look-and-feel and ensure consistency.",
    "Implement theme toggling with a default dark theme and planned warm beige/cream light theme.",
    "Incorporate interactive maps, charts, and carousels to enhance user engagement and showcase offerings.",
    "Support client-side routing with an Express-based server for static hosting and seamless navigation.",
    "Ensure accessibility, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "SPA architecture with React routing managing Home, Bundles, Series, and NotFound views.",
    "Reusable UI component library including navbar, footer, dialogs, forms, tables, and other UI elements.",
    "Theme management via React context and hooks supporting dark and future light themes with CSS variable theming.",
    "Interactive widgets such as embedded maps, charts, and carousels to highlight product offerings.",

  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User visits the website and lands on the Home page featuring a hero section, search, and category filters.",
    "User navigates via navbar to different sections like Bundles, Series, or triggers dialogs such as authentication.",
    "User interacts with interactive widgets like maps, charts, and carousels for browsing offerings.",
    "User toggles between themes, with initial default in dark mode and option for light mode in the future.",
    "User experiences smooth page transitions and animations during navigation.",
    "User utilizes search and filtering tools to find products of interest easily.",
    "Server serves the built SPA assets and handles any unmatched routes with a NotFound page for graceful feedback."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All routes (Home, Bundles, Series, NotFound) must be navigable with correct content rendering.",
    "UI components should be reusable, styled consistently, and responsive across devices.",
    "Theme toggling must correctly apply dark and light theme styles and update CSS variables accordingly.",
    "Interactive widgets (map, chart, carousel) must load correctly, be responsive and interactive.",
    "Express server must serve static assets and support SPA routing fallbacks without errors.",
    "Search and category filter functions should return accurate results matching user input.",
    "Animations and icons integrate seamlessly without visual glitches or performance degradation.",
    "All Bengali text displays correctly with proper encoding and font rendering.",
    "Color contrast must meet accessibility standards for all themes.",
    "Pages and components must load within acceptable performance metrics and optimized bundle size.",
    "Application must be tested and operate correctly on major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.",
    "Loading states should display appropriately during asynchronous operations.",
    "Planned features' placeholders and navigation should be implemented for future expansion.",
    "SEO optimizations and analytics tracking should be in place or scaffolded for implementation.",
    "Multi-language support must handle Bengali and English text toggling smoothly, if implemented."
